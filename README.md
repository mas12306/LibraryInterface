# LibraryInterface
a simple LibraryInterface,but I'm only responsible for the UI part and the rest running part is written by someone else,which is absolutely terrible
## Deficiencies
 * in the running part, I didn't do so much changes in the original part,although the original part is terrible, which the logic of object-oriented programming is confusing, and data is prone to leakage.
 * in the UI part,I did so intricatelyï¼Œ
   
   for example:
   on the page design part, there are so many pages and their codes similiar,but I just copy them and change few places. I try to use functions to solve this problem, but I failed. If you have any good idea , you can connect me [my email](1605359201@qq.com,"qq email") . Hope we can have a talk.

   ## Future expansion
I plan to learn MySQL to creat something new,wish me good luck.
